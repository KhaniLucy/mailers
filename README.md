[Screen recording 2024-02-28 21.41.12.webm](https://github.com/KhaniLucy/mailers/assets/132388392/0d11a109-474b-4efe-bbd0-4711d4549403)



 There are two main types of email you can send and receive, plain text emails (these are exactly what they sound like — any email that contains just plain old text with no formatting) and HTML emails, which are formatted and styled using HTML and inline CSS. HTML emails are easy to spot — most of the style, multimedia marketing emails in your inbox are HTML emails.
The emails are not inherently better than plain text emails, however both types can be part of a successful email marketing program.

# How to create HTML E-mail Template
Good news: 

You actually don’t need to know how to code to create an HTML email. Most tools that create and send email (like HubSpot) will offer pre-formatted, ready-to-go HTML templates that enable you to design emails without ever needing to access the actual code on the back-end. As you make changes in the email editor, those changes will be automatically coded into the final product. Email building tools like this are an ideal option if you don't have an email designer on your team, but you still want to send professional-looking marketing emails. 

## "HTML Email Best Practices   
- Make sure your HTML email is responsive for different screen sizes and devices.             
- Make sure your styling works in different email clients.              
- Be conscious of how long your HTML emails take to load.             
- Plan (as much as you can) for end-user inconsistencies.             
- Conduct thorough testing. 

### Note!
You can still code your HTML from scratch without using most email tools. 

- HTML Email Templates are built using HTMl, CSS only.
- No JavaScript.
- The styling its either inline or internal. It cannot be external.
